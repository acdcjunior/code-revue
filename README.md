# CodeRevue

A mostly social simple (post commit) code review tool.

## Is it any good?

It is written in Vue, backed by a Firestore database.

This tool is written for our team's needs and is supposed to be very simple.
As it is not a mission critical app at all, and most of what is added to it is prototypical (like an idea we
 thought would be cool to have for our team), there aren't many quality requirements other than get it to work!
 
## How to run it?

Download and then:

    npm install
    npm serve
